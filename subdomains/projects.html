                        <h4>About RamsThatCode</h4>
                        <p>Ramsthatcode is a dynamic student club and community centered on hands-on programming and collaborative learning. I regularly participate in and contribute to events like hackathons, and attend bi-weekly lessons where the board teaches programming languages, principles, and libraries. This community fosters an environment where members actively collaborate on projects and support each other's technical growth.

                        <h4>About FRC Team 59</h4>
                        <p>I have been deeply involved with the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) since my freshman year, contributing to a team that has consistently qualified for the World Championship in Houston, including appearances in the final "Einstein" round. Initially assisting with Programming, I now lead the Impact team, where I am responsible for organizing and conducting meetings to plan competition presentations and spearhead community outreach. This role has significantly honed my skills in team organization, leadership, and pitching/selling ideas.
