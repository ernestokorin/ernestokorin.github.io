        I'm incredibly passionate about mathematics as a hobby. I enjoy building my repertoire of math skills & knowledge on my own personal time outside of school. I've recently been focused on building my critical thinking and problem solving with old IMO problems to fortify my knowledge in earlier mathematics outside of calculus: Complex numbers & euler's identity, properties of polynomials, functional equations, recursive equations, sequences, generating functions, induction, etc.
